# The Arctic Ballon Expedition - A History Project

## Summary
This website is intended to provide summarized overall information about the lesser-known Swedish polar expedition in 1987. The intention is to be able to provide a simple website with sharp contrasts, short information that creates curiosity, simple navigation with few pages and a gallery with the images that were found upon discovery of expedition 33 years after the men from the expedition are presumed to have disappeared without a trace.

### Navigation Bar
The aim is to create a simple navigation with three different buttons - one leading to the index, one to the gallery and one to contact. The navigation can be found at the top right of the logo. The menu is simply constructed with a hover effect to clearly show which button you have the mouse over. All pages have the same consistent theme, which makes it easy to see that only the content changes on the page you are on. The menu also makes it easy to navigate back and forth on the pages without having to click the back button.

### Index - Header image
At the top we find the most famous image from the Polar Expedition - a crashed hot air balloon in black and white. The idea with the picture is to create curiosity but also to signal that this website is dedicated to something historical. 


### Main 
In main we find content that briefly summarizes the polar expedition with headlines that gossip about the timeline of the story. The text contains general information about the idea, people and when the events took place. The headings are cast in the same narrative form to maintain a common thread.

### The footer
In the footer we mainly find links to more detailed information such as Wikipedia, but also to various pages with more images from reliable sources. The icons are meant to arouse curiosity and give a nice visual impression. All links open in a new window.

### The Gallery
The gallery consists of a total of four images in a responsive design. The look is meant to give a retro feel with the polaroid frame and descriptive text. The images are also lined up according to the timeline with the first images showing the beginning of the project and the last image showing how the three men were discovered 33 years later after having gone missing.

The Contact page is intended to give the visitor an opportunity to send an email with feedback, questions or concerns about the website's content. The form is simple and direct.

# Features to implement
Actually setting it up to work properly.



# Testing
Live Server, Dev Tools and Mockup
Throughout the entire project, I have by using the extension "Live server" and Dev tools to see how the website takes shape and how the code expresses itself, partly in different browsers but also for different screen sizes. In addition to this, I have also used Mockup to get a clearer picture of how the website looks on different devices.

## Positioning
The problems I've had have mainly been about positioning - getting the header, headings and paragraphs where I want them and for them to work well in a responsive design. Partly, I have had to try my hand at Block and inline-block elements as well as Positioning and Display.

## Images
Another problem has been that the images have not been displayed correctly when I have deployed my website to GitHub. This was easily solved by changing the file name in the code.

## Validator Testing

### HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
### CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

# Deployment
I have used Code Institute's instructional video on how to deploy my website. I have paused the video and followed the instructions.

**The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:**
1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
3. Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
4. The live link can be found here - https://code-institute-org.github.io/love-running-2.0/index.html

# Credits
1. All forms of informative text about the expedition come from Wikipedia.org - both Swedish and English page about Andr√©e - Polar Expeditionen.
2. CSS styling of headings and paragraphs comes from the Love Running project, as does the hero image.
Code for gallery and nav bar were taken from W3schools with own modification.
3. Images for the gallery were taken from Wikipedia, the Swedish National Archives and a Polish history page.
4. The icons in the footer were taken from Font Awesome.
