                <h2>The Explorers </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The second half of the 1800s has often been called the time of the heroic polar explorers.
                    The
                    inhospitable and dangerous regions around the North and South Poles emerged as challenges to
                    male
                    courage and technological achievements. Andrée's plans for his balloon trip fit well into
                    the
                    pattern of
                    the time.</p>

                <h2>The Departure </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Andrée planned to depart in 1896, and had many willing candidates for the few places as
                    expedition
                    participants. He chose the brilliant student Nils Strindberg, who did research in physics
                    and
                    chemistry,
                    and the 27-year-old engineer Knut Frænkel, who was a civil engineer, athlete and mountain
                    hiker
                    as a
                    meteorological observer.</p>

                <h2>The Expedition </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Since Andrée, Strindberg and Frænkel took off with their balloon from Svalbard in July 1897,
                    the
                    balloon
                    quickly lost too much hydrogen and was forced to land on the pack ice after only two days.
                    The
                    travelers
                    were not injured on landing, but had a difficult journey back on foot over the ice.</p>

            <div class="right-about-heading">
                <h2>The Mystery </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>When the Arctic winter came in October, the group camped on Vitön in Svalbard, where they
                    died.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>For 33 years, the fate of the expedition was one of the Arctic's unsolved mysteries, until
                    the
                    camp
                    was
                    discovered by chance in 1930. The discovery created a great sensation in Sweden, where the
                    dead
                    men
                    had
                    been regarded as lost heroes.</p>
