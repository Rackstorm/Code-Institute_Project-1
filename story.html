            <h3>What was it all about?</h3>
            <p>Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897 was a failed effort to reach the North Pole, resulting in the
                deaths of all
                three Swedish expedition members, S. A. Andrée, Knut Frænkel, and Nils Strindberg. Andrée, the first
                Swedish
                balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either Russia or
                Canada, which was
                to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic
                enthusiasm in
                Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind in the race for the North Pole.</p><br>

            <h3>Failing the mission</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>After Andrée, Strindberg, and Frænkel lifted off from Svalbard in July 1897, the balloon lost hydrogen
                quickly and
                crashed on the pack ice after only two days. The explorers were unhurt but faced a grueling trek back
                south across the
                drifting icescape. Inadequately clothed, equipped, and prepared, and shocked by the difficulty of the
                terrain, they did
                not make it to safety. As the Arctic winter closed in on them in October, the group ended up exhausted
                on the deserted
                Kvitøya (White Island) in Svalbard and died there.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Eagle had been stocked with safety equipment such as guns, snowshoes, sleds, skis, a tent, a small boat
                (in the form of
                a bundle of bent sticks, to be assembled and covered with balloon silk), most of it stored not in the
                basket but in the
                storage space arranged above the balloon ring. These items had not been put together with great care,
                and little
                attention was paid to existing designs used by societies living in polar regions. In this, Andrée
                contrasted not only
                with later but also with many earlier explorers.</p><br>

            <p>By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of the provisions overboard. The three men took most of
                the rest with
                them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking
                utensils,
                making a load on each sled of more than 200 kilograms (440 lb). This was not practical, as it broke the
                sleds and wore
                out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential
                equipment, bringing
                the loads down to 130 kilograms (290 lb) per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food.
                They shot and
                ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.</p><br>

            <h3>The discovery of the camp</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>For 33 years the fate of the expedition remained one of the unsolved
                riddles of the Arctic. The chance discovery in 1930 of the expedition's last camp created a media
                sensation in Sweden,
                where the dead men had been mourned and idolized. The Norwegian Bratvaag expedition, studying the
                glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian sealing
                vessel Bratvaag of Ålesund, found the remains of the Andrée expedition on 5 August 1930.</p><br>
